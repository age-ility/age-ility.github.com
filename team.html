  The AGE-ility Project Team
</h1>

<p>
  Associate Professor Frini Karayanidis leads an international team of
  researchers in a longitudinal project that aspires to map the development
  of mental flexibility across the adult lifespan. This multi-disciplinary
  research team includes specialised skills in areas including child
  development, ageing, experimental psychology, clinical psychology, neurology,
  psychiatry, neuroimaging and psychophysiology.
</p>

<p>
  The first phase of the Age-ility Project is funded by an ARC-Discovery
  Project grant. Funding for longitudinal components is currently being sought.
  This will allow us to follow up our cohort and examine implications of
  individual differences in mental flexibility for healthy, resilient
  development, promoting and maintaining good health in old age and
  preventative mental health.

<p>
  A/Professor Karayanidis runs an integrated and collaborative research program
  that aims to understand the organisation of complex cognitive processes, such
  as mental flexibility. The aim of this work is to help us understand
  individual differences in cognitive control and how they influence successful
  adaptive functioning, e.g., emotional control, social integration? This
  program is couched within a model of lifespan development that advocates the
  need for integrative methodologies to understand continuity in development
  across the lifespan by examining links between cognitive, neuronal and
  behavioural levels of analysis.

<p>
  E/Professor Michie has held professorial positions at the University of
  Newcastle, University of Western Australia and Macquarie University. E/Prof
  Michie's primary research interest is in the area of cognitive neuroscience,
  particularly the neural basis of auditory information processing, attention
  and executive functions in healthy individuals, in people with schizophrenia
  and those at risk of psychosis. She has on-going research collaborators will
  colleagues in Finland, Japan, Perth, Sydney and Brisbane. E/Prof Michie has
  been awarded more than $5M in NHMRC funds over the period from 2001-2014. She
  has served as Board member of the Schizophrenia Research Institute and
  represented the University of Newcastle at a senior executive level as
  Pro-Vice Chancellor Research and Acting Deputy Vice Chancellor Research.

<p>
  Professor Forstmann’s research goal is to understand the brain mechanisms
  that allow people to adapt quickly to changes in their environment. Her work
  combines mathematical modeling with functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), ultra-high resolution 7T MRI, and
  electroencephalography (EEG). Her research capitalizes on individual
  differences in psychological processes involved in decision-making and
  interference control. Dr Forstmann has a long-standing collaboration with the
  School of Psychology where she spends part of her year.

<p>
  Professor Lenroot received her medical degree and training in Adult, Child,
  and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico in the United
  States, where she undertook neuroimaging to study adolescents with early
  onset schizophrenia. In Bethesda, Maryland, she worked on longitudinal
  studies of brain development with the Child Psychiatry Branch of the National
  Institutes of Mental Health. Areas of interest included sex differences, twin
  studies to parse out the relative of influences of genetic and environmental
  factor across development, and disorders such as autism. Her current work is
  focused on neuroimaging studies of brain development, how the development of
  social cognition is disturbed in disorders such as autism and schizophrenia,
  and improving mental health interventions for children and adolescents.

<p>
  A/Professor Parsons was Director of the Calvary Mater Hospital Stroke Unit
  from 2003 to 2009 and established the Imaging Research Laboratory at John
  Hunter Hospital. His brain imaging research has been adopted in clinical
  practice to improve the selection of patients for acute stroke therapies
  involving clot-dissolving treatments which can reduce a stroke patient’s
  level of disability and lead to a quicker recovery when administered
  immediately after a stroke. His research interests also include the adverse
  effects of diabetes on stroke outcomes and neurological rehabilitation and
  recovery. His findings linking hyperglycaemia and adverse stroke outcome have
  had major implications for research in this field and potentially, clinical
  guidelines in the future.

<p>
  Professor Phillips’ area of research expertise concerns the neuropsychology
  of executive function in health young and older adults and in patients with
  or at risk for Alzheimer disease or other dementias. She is interested in
  identifying factors which help or hinder our understanding of language and
  how these are influenced by age. Current research examines age differences in
  audio-visual speech processing. With respect to Alzheimer's disease, Dr.
  Phillips is attempting to identify electrophysiological (ERP) markers of
  brain dysfunction that will lead to improved early diagnosis. Her team has
  developed and validated the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), a brief
  cognitive screening test used in the detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment
  in the elderly.

</p>

<p>
  Professor Wagenmakers’ research focuses on developing and testing
  mathematical models for cognition. Such models enable researchers to bridge
  the gap between data that can be directly measured (e.g., response times,
  percentage correct decisions, neuronal firing frequencies) and the latent
  cognitive mechanisms upon which these data are based (e.g., processing speed,
  caution, sensitivity to reward, and control processes). As part of his
  appointment, Wagenmakers will promote a further integration of different
  disciplines - genetics, neuroscience, psychology, biology, physics,
  economics, linguistics – under the theme of 'cognition'. An essential element
  of this integration will be the focus on formal models for behaviour,
  cognition, and information processing.
