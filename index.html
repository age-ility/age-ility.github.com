  <i>Change alone is eternal, perpetual, immortal.</i><br>

  <i>To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.</i><br>
  Winston Churchill

  <i>
    “After all, a healthy person is someone who can manage themselves in the
    uncertain, unpredictable world around them, where novelty and change are
    the norm rather than the exception. In many forms of psychopathology, these
    flexibility processes are absent. If interventions to increase flexibility
    can be informed by strong basic science, we believe there is great untapped
    potential to aid people suffering from pathology, as well help highly
    functioning people find greater efficacy and fulfilment in their daily
    lives”.
