  <p class="quote" style="text-align: left;">
  After all, a healthy person is someone who can manage themselves in the
  uncertain, unpredictable world around them, where novelty and change are
  the norm rather than the exception. In many forms of psychopathology, these
  flexibility processes are absent. If interventions to increase flexibility
  can be informed by strong basic science, we believe there is great untapped
  potential to aid people suffering from pathology, as well help highly
  functioning people find greater efficacy and fulfilment in their daily
  lives.
