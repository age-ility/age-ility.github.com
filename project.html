<p>
Seemingly simple routine behaviours actually involve the careful coordination,
monitoring and adjustment of many underlying processes.
</p>

<p>
Consider, for example, the act of driving to work each day. You need to monitor
traffic and adjust your speed accordingly, look out for pedestrians, check
traffic lights at intersections, prepare to change lanes to take a turn, while
maintaining a mental roadmap of the remaining route to your destination. Each
subcomponent of driving requires the application and integration of many
adaptive control processes. Yet, an experienced driver can effortlessly
integrate all these processes into what appears to be a single task (i.e.,
driving to work) and still have residual capacity to carry out an intelligent
conversation with fellow passengers.
</p>

<p>
However, this fine balance is easily tipped by an unexpected change in road
conditions (e.g., an ambulance siren, a child running onto the road). This
shifts adaptive cognitive processes from a supervisory mode to a full control
mode, requiring the re-evaluation of immediate goals and adjustment of
behaviour so as to prioritise safety. This full control mode is highly
effortful, it needs our full attention and, as a result, other non-essential
functions (i.e., talking, listening) are interrupted until the situation is
cleared and a supervisory mode can be reinstated.
</p>

<p>
Consider now the striking contrast of a learner driver. The learner needs to
concentrate on each component of the task, making driving effortful and
disjointed, and any additional distraction (conversation, music) can be
disruptive. In the learner driver, we can see that well-learned actions, such
as driving, are composed of many subcomponents. Each of these require a
different degree of cognitive control depending on internal (e.g., fatigue,
practice) and external (e.g., traffic density, unexpected events)
contingencies.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="age-ility">Age-ility project</span> focuses on one adaptive cognitive control process that is
crucial to both safely negotiating routine actions, such as driving to work
each day, and adapting to new or unexpected situations. <i><b>Mental flexibility</b></i> is
the ability to strategically adjust behaviour so as to maximise positive
outcomes in an “uncertain, unpredictable world”. Like other adaptive control
processes, cognitive flexibility processes vary across the lifespan, peaking in
mid-late 20s and declining in senescence. However, we know little about the
factors that underlie this variability (i.e., changes in strategy, brain
structure or both). This is the focus of this research.
</p>

<p>
Successful adaptation in our complex and unpredictable world depends on our
ability to adapt to change by flexibly adjusting our behaviour. Mental
flexibility and the brain networks that support it vary across the lifespan.

<h3>Building flexible minds</h3>

<p>
Most of us reach our peak in our mid-late 20s but the rate of maturation
differs vastly across people. This rate depends on a complex interaction
between our ‘hardware’ (for example, the genes we inherit from our parents) and
our ‘software’ (how we use our life’s experiences to grow our brain). Healthy
development into adulthood relies on learning how to deal with the challenges
that arise at each stage of life and applying these skills to deal with bigger
challenges in the future. Mental health problems can arise from maladaptive
learning patterns through childhood and into young adulthood.
</p>

<p>
The Age-ility Project seeks to understand how individual differences in
cognitive flexibility influence successful adaptation during the shift from
adolescence to young adulthood. This is a critical period that often sets
<img src="/images/figure2.jpg" width="170" height="115" style="float: right; margin: 0.5em;"/>
pathways for lifelong patterns of behaviour. It is important to understand the
factors that influence successful adaptation and promote flexible behaviour.
This information can help us identify patterns of problem behaviours early in
life and develop age-specific interventions to promote adaptive outcomes and
thereby promote a healthy start to life.
</p>

<h3>Flexible minds for life</h3>

<p>
The ability to flexibly adapt to new or challenging situations tends to decline
in old age. But, there is large individual variability in the rate of decline.
Indeed, many people retain highly efficient cognitive functioning well into old
age.
</p>

<p>
What factors protect our brain against age-related decline?
</p>

<p>
What factors intensify the rate of decline in mental flexibility?
</p>

<img src="/images/figure3.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em;"/>

<p>
In this project, we examine the relationship between cognitive flexibility and
changes in brain connectivity across the adult lifespan. Difficulties with
adaptive control can compromise the ability to maintain an independent
lifestyle, by interfering with activities of daily living.
</p>

<p>
Although there is a lot of interest in cognitive remediation in ageing, there
has been little evidence of skill transfer into daily life. Using basic science
to understand the mechanisms that mediate adaptive control difficulties in
ageing can inform evidence-based remedial interventions that transfer into
daily activities. In the long-term, this can help prolong healthy, independent
ageing, which would have personal, social and economic implications for ageing
well and productively.
</p>

<p>
In the long term, this information can be implemented to guide the design of
targeted education/prevention programs which will promote development of
adaptive behaviours and improve the transition from adolescence to adulthood
<img src="/images/figure4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0.5em;"/>
and adulthood to senescence. By defining the factors that determine variation
in adaptive executive control in a normative sample, we will have a firm
baseline for understanding variability due to neurodevelopmental and
neurodegenerative disorders, such as schizophrenia, dementia, ADHD and other
disorders. In this way, this knowledge will contribute to promotion of
preventative healthcare.
